    <h1>About PeakOps Automation</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      PeakOps Automation was founded by <strong>Eric Jaffe</strong>, a builder, technologist, and process‑optimizer with a simple mission:
      <em>help professionals and teams reclaim their time by streamlining workflows, improving processes, and automating the work that slows them down.</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Eric’s Background</h2>
    <p>
      Eric’s expertise sits at the intersection of process improvement, automation engineering, workflow design,
      data analysis, and solution building. He has led technology initiatives across multiple teams and partnered closely
      with operations, sales, and product organizations to deliver tools used daily by professionals who depend on accurate,
      fast, and automated workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      From high‑level operational strategy to hands‑on building, Eric has the unique ability to understand the problem
      and deliver the solution — whether that means an automated spreadsheet, a Python script, a dashboard, or a complete workflow redesign.
    </p>

    <h2>Why PeakOps Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Most professionals and teams waste countless hours each week rebuilding reports, copying and pasting data,
      cleaning spreadsheets, updating trackers, and manually compiling information for leadership. Systems feel clunky,
      work feels repetitive, and everyone knows there <em>has</em> to be a better way — but no one has time to build it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eric built PeakOps Automation to fix that. PeakOps helps clients improve processes, increase productivity, reduce manual workload,
      and build tools that create repeatable, scalable efficiency. Every solution is custom‑built to fit how your team works — not the other way around.
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes Eric Different</h2>
    <p>
      Eric combines a builder’s mindset with an operator’s mindset. He doesn’t just write code or clean a spreadsheet —
      he examines the entire workflow, identifies bottlenecks, and redesigns the process so it becomes faster, cleaner, and more scalable.
    </p>
    <p>
      His approach includes understanding the business goal, identifying inefficiencies, designing a better process,
      building custom automations, delivering tools that save time immediately, and documenting everything so teams can adopt and maintain it confidently.
    </p>

    <h2>A Builder at Heart</h2>
    <p>
      Whether it’s a Python script, a dashboard, a reporting engine, a mobile app concept, an intake form, or a complete automation,
      Eric thrives on taking messy, time‑consuming workflows and turning them into clean, efficient systems that just work.
      PeakOps Automation is the result of years of building, experimenting, refining, and helping people work smarter.
    </p>

    <h2>The Mission</h2>
    <p class="highlight">
      At PeakOps, the mission is simple: <strong>empower professionals and teams with better processes, smarter tools,
      and automation that saves real time every week.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If it slows you down, repeats constantly, or takes too long — Eric will streamline it, automate it, or rebuild it from scratch.
