        We help busy professionals and teams design better workflows, eliminate manual work,
        and build automation solutions that scale without burnout.

    <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Most teams are wasting hours every week on work that could be automated or streamlined.
      Not because they're inefficient — but because no one has time to step back and fix the workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      That's where PeakOps comes in. We specialize in finding those opportunities, designing better processes,
      and building the small automations that quietly save hours every month. We focus on what actually works
      in the real world — not perfect solutions that never get used.

        <h3>Process Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          We map your workflows, identify bottlenecks, and redesign processes so they're cleaner,
          faster, and easier for your team to follow.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Custom Automation</h3>
        <p>
          From Excel macros to Python scripts to dashboards, we build solutions that fit into
          your existing stack and actually get used.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Productivity Engineering</h3>
        <p>
          We think like engineers about your operations. Small, repeatable systems that reduce
          friction and let your team focus on high-value work.

    <h2>Why We're Different</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No unnecessary complexity.</strong> We build solutions that are easy to understand and maintain.</li>
      <li><strong>Real-world focus.</strong> We care about what actually improves your day-to-day, not what looks impressive in a slide deck.</li>
      <li><strong>Fast results.</strong> Most clients see tangible time savings within 30–60 days.</li>
      <li><strong>Your tools first.</strong> We work with Excel, Sheets, Python, dashboards, and your existing tech stack — not forcing you to adopt new platforms.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainable growth.</strong> We help you scale without hiring more people or burning out your team.</li>
