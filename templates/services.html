    <p class="lead">
      PeakOps Automation blends process improvement, productivity engineering, and custom technology solutions
      to help you work faster, cleaner, and more efficiently.
    </p>

    <h2>Process &amp; Productivity Optimization</h2>
    <p>
      We start by understanding how your work actually gets done today. Then we map “as-is” workflows, identify bottlenecks,
      and design “to-be” processes that are simpler, faster, and easier to follow.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Workflow analysis &amp; redesign</li>
      <li>“As-is” vs. “to-be” process mapping</li>
      <li>Time-motion and bottleneck analysis</li>
      <li>SOPs and playbooks for repeatable work</li>
      <li>Standardization across teams and roles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Automation &amp; Custom Tools</h2>
    <p>
      Once the process is clear, we build the tools that make it run. From lightweight automations to more complex
      scripts and dashboards, we focus on practical solutions you can use right away.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Excel &amp; Google Sheets automation and macros</li>
      <li>Python scripts, data pipelines, and APIs</li>
      <li>Dashboards (e.g., KPI and operational views)</li>
      <li>Internal tools and mini-apps for recurring workflows</li>
      <li>Automated reporting cycles and scheduled jobs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data, Reporting &amp; Insights</h2>
    <p>
      Data should support decisions — not slow them down. We help clean, structure, and automate the movement of data so
      that your reporting is timely, accurate, and easy to understand.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated report generation</li>
      <li>KPI dashboards and scorecards</li>
      <li>Data cleanup, normalization, and transformation</li>
      <li>Data mining and analysis for operational insights</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Executive &amp; Team Productivity Packages</h2>
    <p>
      For leaders and teams that want ongoing support, PeakOps provides recurring services to maintain, evolve, and continuously
      improve your processes and tools.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regular process and workflow reviews</li>
      <li>New automation and enhancement roadmaps</li>
      <li>Executive dashboards and summary reports</li>
      <li>Support for rollout, training, and adoption</li>
    </ul>
